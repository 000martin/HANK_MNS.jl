# Replication of McKay, Nakamura, and Steinsson (2017)

This is a replication of ["The Power of Forward Guidance"](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20150063) by Alisdair McKay, Emi Nakamura, and JÃ³n Steinsson.

The project was part of our evaluation for the course [Numerical Methods](https://floswald.github.io/NumericalMethods/) at SciencesPo Paris in Spring 2021. 

In this replication we analyze how sensitive forward guidance is to the assumption of complete markets.
